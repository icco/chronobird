=============

This will and should grab my most recent twits and append them to a file (named **_twit.txt**) and commit.

INSTALL
-------

First get these python libraries

 * [git_python][1]
 * [Python Twitter][2]
 
Then run run.py, **Tah dah**!

NOTES
------

Btw. Only tested on Linux, because it's awesome.

LICENSE
--------

GPL v3 I guess. Maybe not... I don't know. Creative Commons? Meh. Just give me credit and share your code too.
